Research Work
==============

The following works are research projects I had worked on
in academic research labs, for personal interest, or cleared while
working on commercial projects.

Java Normalization
------------------

This project aimed at discovering plagurised code by normalizing 
code forms, comparing those forms, and measuring the distance/effort 
in generating them.


P2PUsenet
---------

This was a project I did in college for my architecture class, 
a fully peer-to-peer version of a Usenet-like system.  
Documents in the project's `doc` directory walk through the architecture.
It features:

* P2P via JXTA
* A plugin system that supports multiple languages (Python, Ruby, Scheme, Haskell, Common Lisp, JavaScript)
* A C2 Event system implemented on top of Peers and SuperPeers.
