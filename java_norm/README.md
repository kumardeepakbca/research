Java Normalization
==================

The goal of this project was to detect when two
software projects shared the same origin, with the purpose
of detecting software plagiarism.

Two pieces of source code are normalized, and the distance or effort to
make that normalization is made.  If the effort is roughly the same, and
the normalized structures matched, plagiarism is likely.
